# mock-form-submission
A mock javascript form submission using only client side methods.


Assignment4 -- JavaScript Form

Overview
- no in-document style declarations
- no inline styles
- all CSS will be included from an external file
- no in-document JS
- no inline JS
- all JS will be included from an external file
- you can name these files whatever you like
- remember that points will be deducted for not following the style guide

The assignment can be about anything you want as well. Whatever information you want the form to "collect" is completely up to you.

## Instructions

***1. Create your file tree***
 - you will need folders for
   - CSS
   - JS
   - Images (if you use any)
 - you will need to put an index.html file at the root to display the page
 
***2. Your `index.html` file will contain the following:***
 - the form and all necessary components
   - attributes, etc
   - submit mechanism
   - any type of inputs you want to use
   - make use of semantic html form elements and design as well
   - all form inputs must have the necessary attributes, etc.
   
***3. Style the form***
 - have fun with this, it doesn't need to be a masterpiece
 - use what we have learned so far in class, if that's not enough, look around the internet for some inspiration
 - just don't copy and paste, that's cheating. I want you to write the CSS by yourself
 - no CSS libraries (boostrap, foundation, etc)
 
***4. Add the functionality with JS***
 - no external JS libraries except for jQuery will be allowed
 - upon submitting the form one of two things should happen
    - if there is an error (input not filled in, bad data, etc) errors should appear
    - the errors should be styled in a way that the user will know if something's wrong
    - the `name` of the input should be used to say where the error is
    - if everything is good to go, the form should disappear from view and be replaced with some sort of success messaging
    - both error and success states will be tested
    - submitting the form in any case should ***NOT*** refresh the page (since we aren't really sending this data anywhere)
